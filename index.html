    <h2>The Arrival</h2>
        <p>Hello, in case you didn't pay attention, my name is Eros Pena. I was born in a place called Havana, Cuba; a beautiful place full of joy and culture. About 5 years ago I moved to the United States. Without knowing the language I struggled to pass classes at school at first, but within less than a year I was doing great and my English was not perfect, or close of being; however I  managed to pass High School with an average of 3.67 GPA. Although that does not seem very impressive at all, I started high school in my junior year; only two years until graduation, not only that, but My English started getting better at the Senior year. Two year of high school was quite a challenge, but it was a great experience overall. </p>
    <h2> My early college experience</h2>
        <p>I started college about two years ago, at first I wanted to be an architect like my Dad; however, it did not take me long to realize that I was not meant to be one. I was more interested in things like technology and music. I started my journey at Florida Southwestern College, I completed an Associates in Arts last summer,  my first achievement as a college student. However, I knew my career had just started. I decided to become a Software Engineer a little late than others so I am still taking some beginners classes; however, my advantage is that I have college experience and all my general requirements done.  </p>
